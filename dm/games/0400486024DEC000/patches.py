# The game's frame ratio. Once a frame the function at main+0x6e6be0 (v131072) divides its base rate (60.0, or 30.0 while bit 0 of [x21+0x24f] is set) by the int frame rate at
# [x21+0x2c8] (fdiv s8,s1,s0 at +0xe4) and hands the result to the time object (main+0x3b4e300: ratio at +0x10, 1 / ratio at +0x14, round(60 / ratio) at +0x1c), which the game
# steps by; the frame's own time never enters it, so a frame that takes two vsyncs at rate 60 plays at half speed. The stub gives the ratio the host's step instead: step × base / 60
# (the division's value when the host keeps frames 60 / rate vsyncs), and counts the vsyncs stepped. Until the host has decided a step, and at fps_target 0, the division runs.
# Below the target the frames are not whole vsyncs long (55-59.7 fps in the heavy areas of a GPU-bound Mac), so the stub then takes the larger of that ratio and base x the measured
# frame time (state +0x38, float seconds, 0 = at the target; hle_nvn.c fstep_tick, which pays back no whole vsync beside it). It marks state +0x3c so the host measures only for a
# main that reads the value (found by gunvalk, zortos293/Lichii PR #216; DM_FRAME_DELTA=0 leaves +0x38 at 0).
# s0 and x16 / x17 are free there (s0 is written again on every path before it is read; the function uses neither x16 nor x17); s1 keeps the base rate.
# Lichii (a GPL emulator; only the fact was taken) found the division (its notes: main+0x6E6CC4, 60 / [x21+0x2C8])
